    <br>She doesn't call before midnight, if at all </br>
   <br>Oh, she never stays to watch the night turn to day</br>
   <br>But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want</br>
   <br>I wish you were mine in the broad daylight
But you just use me baby, anyway you want</br>
<br>I wish you were mine but</br>
<br>She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off</br>
<br>She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down</br>
<br>She only loves me when no one's around, one's around</br>
<br>She only loves me cause I put it down</br>
<br>And it's fine by me</br>
<br>And it's fine by me</br>
<br>She's like the wind, she comes and goes and again</br>
<br>All of my friends think I'm a fool, silly them</br>
<br>But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight</br>
<br>But you just use me baby, anyway you want</br>
    </p>
